## POD

The `ACS` Version 1.1.0 beta release supports:

## POD Examples
In the pod/examples directory, there are four POD user exmples: 

## Example 1 - (pod/examples/ex1):

* In this example we start with the IGS final SP3 file igs19424.sp3 as a pseuodo-observation. 
  We then fit each satellite with an ECOM-1 solar radiation pressure model.

Here is a screen grab of running Example #1

## Example 2 - (pod/examples/ex2):

* Multi GNSS CODE MGEX SP3 file orbit fitting. In this example we start with at CODE MGEX SP3 file COD0MGXFIN_20191990000_01D_05M_ORB.SP3 as a pseuodo-observation. 
  We then fit each satellite with an ECOM-2 solar radiation pressure model.

## Example 3 - (pod/examples/ex3):

* GPS IGS SP3 file orbit fitting, orbit prediction and comparison to next IGS SP3 file

## Example 4 - (pod/examples/ex4):

* Integration of POD initial conditions file generated by the PEA

In each example directory (ex1/ex2/ex3/ex4) there is a sh_ex? script that when exectuted 
will run the example and compare the output with the expected solution.
