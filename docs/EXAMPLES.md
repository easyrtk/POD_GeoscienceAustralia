## Example 2 - (pod/examples/ex2):

* Multi GNSS CODE MGEX SP3 file orbit fitting

## Example 3 - (pod/examples/ex3):

* GPS IGS SP3 file orbit fitting, orbit prediction and comparison to next IGS SP3 file

## Example 4 - (pod/examples/ex4):

* Integration of POD initial conditions file generated by the PEA

In each example directory (ex1/ex2/ex3/ex4) there is a sh_ex? script that when exectuted
